## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security issue in any of our repositories, please bring it to our attention privately. To report a vulnerability, use the form available in the [Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) of the given repository.

In the report, include as much of the information listed below as you can:

- The type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This will help us better understand the issue and resolve it more efficiently.
