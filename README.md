## About .github

This repo stores default health docs for repositories and the organization homepage profile.

GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository in the organization that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the `.github` folder
- the `docs` folder

For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a repository that does not have its own CONTRIBUTING file will see a link to the default CONTRIBUTING file. If a repository has any files in its own `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder, including issue templates or a config.yml file, none of the contents of the default `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder will be used.

Default files wonâ€™t appear in the file browser or Git history and are not included in clones, packages, or downloads of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.

**Note:** You cannot create a default license file. License files must be added to individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is cloned, packaged, or downloaded.
